2.3 release notes
#################

.. warning::
    
    Django CMS 2.3 is still in development

*****************
What's new in 2.3
*****************

Introducing Django 1.4 support, dropped support for Django 1.2
==============================================================

In django CMS 2.3 we dropped support for Django 1.2. Django 1.3.1 is now the
minimum required Django version. Django CMS 2.3 also introduces Django 1.4
support.


Lazy page tree loading in admin
===============================

Thanks to the work by Andrew Schoen the page tree in the admin now loads lazily,
improving the performance of that view for large sites significantly.


Toolbar isolation
=================

The toolbar JavaScript dependencies should now be properly isolated and no
longer pollutes the global JavaScript namespace. 


Plugin cancel button fixed
==========================

The cancel button in plugin change forms no longer saves the changes, but 
actually cancels.


Tests refactor
==============

Tests can now be run using ``setup.py test`` or ``runtests.py`` (the latter
should be done in a virtualenv with the proper dependencies installed).

Check ``runtests.py -h`` for options.


Moving text plugins to different placeholders no longer loses inline plugins
============================================================================

A serious bug where moving a text plugin with inline plugins would lose all
the inline plugins when moved to a different placeholder was fixed.


Minor improvements
==================

* The ``or`` clause in the ``placeholder`` tag now correctly works on non-cms
  pages.
* The icon source URL for inline plugins for text plugins no longer gets double
  escaped.
* ``PageSelectWidget`` correctly orders pages again.
* Fixed the file plugin sometimes causing invalid HTML (unclosed ``span`` tag).
* Migration ordering for plugins improved.
* Internationalized strings in JavaScript now get escaped.


******************************
Backwards incompatible changes
******************************

New minimum requirements for dependencies
=========================================

* ``django-reversion`` must now be at version 1.6
* ``django-sekizai`` must be at least at version 0.6.1
* ``django-mptt`` version 0.5.1 or 0.5.2 is required


********************
Pending deprecations
********************

The ``CMS_FLAT_URLS`` setting is deprecated and will be removed in version 2.4.
